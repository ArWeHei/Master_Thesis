We aim at developing an AI methodology that facilitates attribution of drawings of unknown authors in a way that is not easy to be deceived by forged art. The methodology used is based on quantifying the characteristics of individual strokes in drawings. We propose a novel algorithm for segmenting individual strokes. We designed and compared different hand-crafted and learned features for the task of quantifying stroke characteristics. We also propose and compare different classification methods at the drawing level. We experimented with a dataset of 300 digitized drawings with over 80 thousands strokes. The collection mainly consisted of drawings of Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, and Egon Schiele, besides a small number of representative works of other artists. The experiments shows that the proposed methodology can classify individual strokes with accuracy 70\%-90\%, and aggregate over drawings with accuracy above 80\%, while being robust to be deceived by fakes (with accuracy 100\% for detecting fakes in most settings).}},

abstract = {{Relief is an art form part way between 3D sculpture and 2D painting. We present a novel approach for generating a texture-mapped high-relief model from a single brush painting. Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing. As a result, our brushstroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared towards paintings with each brushstroke drawn very purposefully, such as Chinese paintings, Rosemailing paintings, etc.}},

abstract = {{The automatic extraction of objective features from paintings, like brushstroke distribution, orientation, and shape, could be particularly useful for different artwork analyses and management tasks. In fact, these features contribute to provide a unique signature of the artists’ style and can be effectively used for artist identification and classification, artwork examination and retrieval, etc. In this paper, an automatic technique for unsupervised extraction of individual brushstrokes from digital reproductions of van Gogh’s paintings is presented. Through the iterative application of segmentation, characterization, and validation steps, valid brushstrokes complying with specific area and shape constraints are identified. On the extracted brushstrokes, several representative features can then be calculated, like orientation, length, and width. The accuracy of the devised method is evaluated by comparing numerical results obtained on a dataset of digital reproductions of van Gogh’s oil-on-canvas works with observations made by human subjects and with another recent approach for automatic brushstroke analysis. Experimental tests showed that the devised methodology produces results that are rather close to those obtained by human subjects and, for some of the metrics considered, can provide improved performances with respect to alternative techniques.}},

To address these challenges, we develop a two-branch model that learns separate filters for generating sketchy outlines and tonal shading from a collection of pencil drawings. We create training data pairs by extracting clean outlines and tonal illustrations from original pencil drawings using image filtering techniques, and we manually label the drawing styles. In addition, our model creates different pencil styles (e.g., line sketchiness and shading style) in a user-controllable manner. Experimental results on different types of pencil drawings show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods in terms of quality, diversity and user evaluations.}},

Among approaches to digitally synthesizing natural media painting strokes, physically based simulation produces by far the most realistic visual results and allows the most intuitive control of stroke variations. However, accurate physics simulations are known to be computationally expensive and often cannot meet the performance requirements of painting applications. In our work, we propose to replace the expensive fluid simulation with a neural network. The network takes the existing canvas and a new stroke trajectory as input and produces the height and color of the new stroke as output. We train the network with a dataset generated with a high quality offline simulator. The network is able to produce visual quality comparable to the offline simulator with better performance than the existing real-time oil painting simulator. Finally, we implement a real-time painting system using the trained network.}},

We present a novel technique called the (prevailing orientation extraction technique (POET)). The technique is based on a straightforward circular filter and a dedicated orientation extraction phase; it performs at a level that is undistinguishable from that of humans. From our experimental results we may conclude that POET supports the automatic extraction of the spatial distribution of oriented brushstrokes.

abstract = {{Our goal in this paper is to discover near duplicate patterns in large collections of artworks. This is harder than standard instance mining due to differences in the artistic media (oil, pastel, drawing, etc), and imperfections inherent in the copying process. The key technical insight is to adapt a standard deep feature to this task by fine-tuning it on the specific art collection using self-supervised learning. More specifically, spatial consistency between neighbouring feature matches is used as supervisory fine-tuning signal. The adapted feature leads to more accurate style-invariant matching, and can be used with a standard discovery approach, based on geometric verification, to identify duplicate patterns in the dataset. The approach is evaluated on several different datasets and shows surprisingly good qualitative discovery results. For quantitative evaluation of the method, we annotated 273 near duplicate details in a dataset of 1587 artworks attributed to Jan Brueghel and his workshop. Beyond artwork, we also demonstrate improvement on localization on the Oxford5K photo dataset as well as on historical photograph localization on the Large Time Lags Location (LTLL) dataset.}},

The second one is composed of paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries, made available by the Van Gogh and Kröller-Müller Museums (Netherlands) in the framework of the Image processing for Art Investigation research program.
