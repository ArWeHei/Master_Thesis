abstract = {{A texture transfer algorithm modifies the target image replacing the high frequency information with the example source image. Previous texture transfer techniques normally use such factors as color distance and standard deviation for selecting the best texture from the candidate sets. These factors are useful for expressing a texture effect of the example source in the target image, but are less than optimal for considering the object shape of the target image. In this paper, we propose a novel texture transfer algorithm to express the directional effect based on the flow of the target image. For this, we use a directional factor that considers the gradient direction of the target image. We add an additional energy term that respects the image gradient to the previous fast texture transfer algorithm. Additionally, we propose a method for estimating the directional factor weight value from the target image. We have tested our algorithm with various target images. Our algorithm can express a result image with the feature of the example source texture and the flow of the target image.}},

abstract = {{This paper describes a new framework for processing images by example, called “image analogies.” The framework involves two stages: a design phase, in which a pair of images, with one image purported to be a “filtered” version of the other, is presented as “training data”; and an application phase, in which the learned filter is applied to some new target image in order to create an “analogous” filtered result. Image analogies are based on a simple multi-scale autoregression, inspired primarily by recent results in texture synthesis. By choosing different types of source image pairs as input, the framework supports a wide variety of “image filter” effects, including traditional image filters, such as blurring or embossing; improved texture synthesis, in which some textures are synthesized with higher quality than by previous approaches; super-resolution, in which a higher-resolution image is inferred from a low-resolution source; texture transfer, in which images are “texturized” with some arbitrary source texture; artistic filters, in which various drawing and painting styles are synthesized based on scanned real-world examples; and texture-by-numbers, in which realistic scenes, composed of a variety of textures, are created using a simple painting interface.}},

This formulation allows us to specify painting style by varying the relative weights of energy terms. The basic energy function yields an economical style that conveys an image with few strokes. This style produces greater temporal coherence for video than previous techniques. The system allows as fine user control as desired: the user may interactively change the painting style, specify variations of style over an image, and/or add specific strokes to the painting.}},

Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing. As a result, our brushstroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared towards paintings with each brushstroke drawn very purposefully, such as Chinese paintings, Rosemailing paintings, etc.}},

Through the iterative application of segmentation, characterization, and validation steps, valid brushstrokes complying with specific area and shape constraints are identified. On the extracted brushstrokes, several representative features can then be calculated, like orientation, length, and width. The accuracy of the devised method is evaluated by comparing numerical results obtained on a dataset of digital reproductions of van Gogh’s oil-on-canvas works with observations made by human subjects and with another recent approach for automatic brushstroke analysis. Experimental tests showed that the devised methodology produces results that are rather close to those obtained by human subjects and, for some of the metrics considered, can provide improved performances with respect to alternative techniques.}},

We create training data pairs by extracting clean outlines and tonal illustrations from original pencil drawings using image filtering techniques, and we manually label the drawing styles. In addition, our model creates different pencil styles (e.g., line sketchiness and shading style) in a user-controllable manner.

However, accurate physics simulations are known to be computationally expensive and often cannot meet the performance requirements of painting applications. In our work, we propose to replace the expensive fluid simulation with a neural network. The network takes the existing canvas and a new stroke trajectory as input and produces the height and color of the new stroke as output. We train the network with a dataset generated with a high quality offline simulator. The network is able to produce visual quality comparable to the offline simulator with better performance than the existing real-time oil painting simulator. Finally, we implement a real-time painting system using the trained network.}},

The adapted feature leads to more accurate style-invariant matching, and can be used with a standard discovery approach, based on geometric verification, to identify duplicate patterns in the dataset. The approach is evaluated on several different datasets and shows surprisingly good qualitative discovery results. For quantitative evaluation of the method, we annotated 273 near duplicate details in a dataset of 1587 artworks attributed to Jan Brueghel and his workshop.

abstract = {{Art historians have long observed the highly characteristic brushstroke styles of Vincent van Gogh and have relied on discerning these styles for authenticating and dating his works. In our work, we compared van Gogh with his contemporaries by statistically analyzing a massive set of automatically extracted brushstrokes. A novel extraction method is developed by exploiting an integration of edge detection and clustering-based segmentation. Evidence substantiates that van Gogh's brushstrokes are strongly rhythmic. That is, regularly shaped brushstrokes are tightly arranged, creating a repetitive and patterned impression. We also found that the traits that distinguish van Gogh's paintings in different time periods of his development are all different from those distinguishing van Gogh from his peers. This study confirms that the combined brushwork features identified as special to van Gogh are consistently held throughout his French periods of production (1886-1890).}},
