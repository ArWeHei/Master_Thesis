%goal achieved?

%appraoch is very slow
%brushstrokes are not blended naturally
%brush strokes lack some detail -> maybe add environment variable or such
%nice image resolution
%can this be realized in a feed-forward manner?
%Is this something that will be used in the future

%is probably a state of the art painterly rendering appraoch

%brush stroke extraction depends heavily on the image, some strokes are very good, some are just wrong.
%comparable to previous brush stroke extraction algorithms

% parametrized representation is interesting for graph neural networks and other ermerging techniques.
