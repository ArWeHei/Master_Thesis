\chapter{Evaluations \& Ablation Experiments}
\labch{Ablations}

In this chapter, the ablation experiments for to the approaches presented in \refch{approach}
shall be presented.
This is meant to show some weaknesses of each method as well as give a visual understanding
of the effects of some losses and parameters.
Together with an interpretation it should help to get a better understanding of previous
motivations.


\section{Neural Renderer}
\labsec{ablation_renderer}

The neural renderer will be evaluated with respect to a few aspects.
First, the performance for larger resolution images will be evaluated.
Then, the effect of the discriminator will shown by training the renderer without
the discriminator loss.
At last, the weakness of the renderer, which is data points outside the training space,
will be analyzed.

\section{Optimization Procedure}
\labsec{abl:Opt}

The optimization procedure gives many starting points for ablation experiments.
At first, the effects of each loss will be visually compared.
Then, different initializations will be shown as well as various choices for training
parameters.
